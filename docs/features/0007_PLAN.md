# Plan: Fix Main Menu Button Overlap

## Description

Fix overlapping buttons in the main navigation menu when displayed in English. The navigation links (Dashboard, Market, Market Analysis, Portfolio, CO2 Emissions, About Nihao, Documentation) are overlapping with the right-side controls (dark mode toggle, language selector, balance, profile menu) on certain screen sizes, particularly at the `lg` breakpoint (1024px).

## Problem Analysis

Current implementation in `src/components/Header.tsx` has:
- Navigation container with `lg:space-x-2 xl:space-x-4` spacing
- Text sizing `text-xs xl:text-sm` (too small on `lg` screens)
- Padding `px-2 xl:px-3` (too tight on `lg` screens)
- Main container gap `gap-x-4 lg:gap-x-6` (may be insufficient)
- Navigation links use `whitespace-nowrap` which prevents wrapping but can cause overflow

The English menu items are:
- Dashboard
- Market
- Market Analysis
- Portfolio
- CO2 Emissions
- About Nihao
- Documentation

## Files to Modify

### `src/components/Header.tsx`

1. **Increase navigation spacing** (line 53)
   - Change `lg:space-x-2` to `lg:space-x-3` or `lg:space-x-4` for better separation
   - Ensure consistent spacing across breakpoints

2. **Adjust text sizing** (line 61)
   - Change `text-xs xl:text-sm` to `text-sm` for better readability and prevent cramping
   - Or use `text-xs lg:text-sm` to start normal size earlier

3. **Increase padding** (line 61)
   - Change `px-2 xl:px-3` to `px-3` or `px-2 lg:px-3` for better touch targets and spacing

4. **Enhance main container gap** (line 45)
   - Increase `gap-x-4 lg:gap-x-6` to `gap-x-6 lg:gap-x-8` for more space between navigation and controls

5. **Ensure proper flex behavior**
   - Verify `flex-shrink-0` is applied to both navigation container (line 53) and controls container (line 136)
   - Consider adding `min-w-0` to allow proper flex shrinking if needed

6. **Add responsive overflow handling**
   - Consider adding `overflow-x-auto` with `scrollbar-hide` for very small screens if needed
   - Or implement a dropdown menu for navigation items on smaller `lg` screens

## Implementation Details

- Maintain existing responsive breakpoints (`lg` at 1024px, `xl` at 1280px)
- Preserve dark mode support
- Ensure accessibility (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation) remains intact
- Test with English translations to verify no overlap
- Ensure mobile menu (below `lg` breakpoint) remains unaffected

## Testing

- Test at `lg` breakpoint (1024px) with English language
- Verify all navigation links are visible and clickable
- Verify no overlap between navigation links and right-side controls
- Test with different screen sizes between `lg` and `xl` breakpoints
- Verify dark mode functionality remains intact
