BUYER-INST-0089: "Quote accepted on ratio 1:10.5.

Ratio stays 1:10.5 with standard T+2. 
Your preference?"

## APPENDIX: PRICING ENGINE (Backend)

### CEA Price Discovery

**Formula**:
```
Nihao Offered Price = (Shanghai_ETS_Spot) Ã— (1 + Premium%) 

Where Premium% = f(volume, seller_tier, market_demand, buyer_composition)

Example:
  Shanghai spot: â‚¬7.89/t
  Buyer demand index: High (multiple inquiries)
  Volume: 2M tonnes (large, liquid)
  Premium offered: +7.5%
  
  Nihao ask: â‚¬7.89 Ã— 1.075 = â‚¬8.48/t
```

---

### EUAâ†”CEA Swap Ratio

**Formula**:
```
Swap Ratio = (EUA_Spot / CEA_Spot) Ã— (1 + Ratio_Premium%)

Where Ratio_Premium% = f(volume_efficiency, institutional_demand, execution_speed)

Example:
  EUA spot: â‚¬85/t
  CEA spot: â‚¬8.50/t
  Implied ratio: â‚¬85 / â‚¬8.50 = 1:10.0
  
  Nihao enhancement: +5% (1:10.5)
  
  Offered ratio: 1:10.5
  Swap value: 5.88M EUA â†’ 61.74M CEA
```

---

### Dynamic Fee Structure

```
CEA SALES (to Nihao buyer):
  Volume < 1M t:           0.4% (â‚¬40k per â‚¬10M)
  Volume 1-5M t:           0.3% (â‚¬30k per â‚¬10M)
  Volume 5M+ t:            0.2% (â‚¬20k per â‚¬10M)

INSTITUTIONAL SWAPS:
  Volume < â‚¬100M:          0.6% (â‚¬600k per â‚¬100M)
  Volume â‚¬100-500M:        0.5% (â‚¬500k per â‚¬100M)
  Volume â‚¬500M+:           0.4% (â‚¬400k per â‚¬100M)

BUYER CEA PURCHASES:
  Volume < 500k t:         0.3% (facilitation only)
  Volume 500k-5M t:        0.2%
  Volume 5M+ t:            0.15%
