## 0. STRUCTURE OF THIS DOCUMENT

This guide explains, in practical and numerical terms, why using Nihao is advantageous for:

1. **Chinese CEA Sellers** – entities with surplus China Emission Allowances (CEA)  
2. **EU CEA Buyers & Swappers** – EU entities that want to buy CEA and then swap into EUA  
3. **EUA Holders (Asia/EU)** – funds or corporates holding EUA that prefer to swap into CEA via Nihao  

Each section includes:

- Realistic numerical examples  
- Side‑by‑side comparisons vs direct market routes  
- Tax, cash‑flow, and risk implications  
- A clear economic conclusion for decision‑makers

## 1. CHINESE CEA SELLERS – WHY SELL CEA TO NIHAO INSTEAD OF THE EXCHANGE

### 1.1 Baseline: What a Typical Seller Looks Like

Assume:

- Large coal or gas-fired power plant in China  
- Compliance obligations fully met for the year  
- **Surplus**: 2,000,000 CEA  
- Objective: Monetize surplus quickly, with minimal market impact, optimal tax and FX structure  

The plant has two routes:

1. Sell CEA **directly on the Shanghai ETS**  
2. Sell CEA **off‑exchange via Nihao** (bilateral OTC deal)  

***

### 1.2 Scenario A – Direct Sale on Shanghai ETS

**Mechanics**

- List 2,000,000 CEA on the exchange  
- Reference market price: **¥60/CEA** (≈ €7.06 at ¥8.50/€)  

Because of limited liquidity and market impact:

- Off‑season discount: ~3%  
- Large‑volume / “block” discount: ~5%  
- Effective average execution price drops below visible screen price  

**Execution path (simplified):**

- Batch 1 (500k): ¥58.2/t (‑3%)  
- Batch 2 (500k): ¥57.5/t  
- Batch 3 (500k): ¥56.8/t  
- Batch 4 (500k): ¥56.1/t  

**Volume‑weighted average price (VWAP)** ≈ **¥57.15/CEA**

**Gross proceeds**

- 2,000,000 × ¥57.15 = **¥114,300,000**

**Cost and tax impact (domestic sale)**

- Exchange fees (~0.2%): ≈ ¥229,000  
- VAT 6% on the sale value: ≈ **¥6,900,000**  
- Internal cost (trading/compliance staff, 1–2 months): say **¥500,000**  

**Net cash to seller**

- ¥114.3M – ¥229k – ¥6.9M – ¥0.5M ≈ **¥106.67M**  
- In euro (¥8.5/€): **~€12.55M**

Additional qualitative issues:

- Trade is public → market sees a large seller  
- Potential reputational / political questions (for SOEs)  
- Execution takes **weeks**, not days  
- All proceeds in RMB, subject to capital controls  

***

### 1.3 Scenario B – Bilateral Sale via Nihao

**Mechanics**

1. Seller sends a **confidential proposal** to Nihao:
   - 2,000,000 CEA  
   - Desired settlement window: 72 hours  
2. Nihao canvasses its EU and international client base:
   - Industrial buyers, funds, compliance desks  
3. Nihao aggregates demand and negotiates a **single all‑in price** for the full block

Assume:

- Screen reference still ¥60/CEA  
- Nihao can extract a premium due to:
  - Access to EUR/USD buyers  
  - No forced liquidation signal  
  - Better execution algorithms  

Nihao’s pricing outcome (example):

- Base: ¥60  
- Premium for EUR access + OTC certainty: +2.5% → ¥61.5  
- Additional efficiency (no sequential dumps): +0.5% → ¥62  

**All‑in price**: **¥62/CEA**, **for the entire 2M block**

**Gross proceeds**

- 2,000,000 × ¥62 = **¥124,000,000**

**Cost and tax impact (export‑style structure)**

- Nihao fee: e.g. **0.3%** on notional → ¥372,000  
- VAT: structured as **export of quotas** → effectively **0% VAT** on output, plus potential input VAT refunds  
- Internal staff time: far lower (few days) – say **¥100,000**  

**Net cash to seller**

- ¥124M – ¥372k – ¥100k ≈ **¥123.53M**  
- In euro: **~€14.53M**

***

### 1.4 Comparison – Hard Numbers for the 2M CEA Seller

| Item                            | Shanghai ETS (Direct) | Nihao OTC            |
|---------------------------------|------------------------|----------------------|
| Average realized price/CEA      | ¥57.15                 | ¥62.00               |
| Gross proceeds                  | ¥114.30M              | ¥124.00M             |
| VAT outflow                     | ~¥6.90M               | ~¥0                  |
| Fees & internal costs           | ~¥0.73M               | ~¥0.47M              |
| Net cash                        | **¥106.67M**          | **¥123.53M**         |
| Net in euro                     | **~€12.55M**          | **~€14.53M**         |
| Incremental benefit             | –                      | **+¥16.86M (~€1.98M)** |

So the same 2M surplus CEA produce:

- **~15–16% more cash** using Nihao  
- In addition to better tax treatment, faster execution, more discretion, better FX flexibility  

***

### 1.5 Tax Optimization for Chinese CEA Sellers (High‑Level)

Using Nihao, the seller can:

1. **Treat CEA as inventory (for trading)** rather than intangible:
   - Full cost of CEA can be deducted in the year of sale, instead of amortized over 10+ years  
   - This directly lowers the **CIT base** in the current year  

2. **Use export VAT treatment**:
   - Domestic CEA sale: 6% VAT output on full amount  
   - Structured as export of allowances: 0% VAT output + ability to reclaim input VAT from ETS‑related expenses (consulting, MRV systems, etc.)  

3. **Combine with environmental-investment incentives**:
   - If the plant invested in energy efficiency or pollution‑control equipment, it can claim:
     - 10% investment tax credit on qualifying equipment  
     - Reduced CIT rate (e.g. 15% vs 25%)  
     - Tax holidays for specific environmental projects  

Economic result (illustrative for 1M CEA):

- Direct domestic sale: CIT + VAT could easily be **¥17M+ total tax burden**  
- Nihao export + inventory treatment + incentives: tax could be close to **zero or even net positive (credit/refund)**  

This turns Nihao into a **tax and cash‑flow optimization tool**, not just a trading intermediary.

***

### 1.6 Risk, Speed, and Reputation

**Speed**

- Exchange route: 3–5 weeks from “decision” to “cash in bank”  
- Nihao: typically **3–5 days**  

**Risk & Insurance**

- Exchange: no specific trade‑level insurance; counterparty/custody risk handled by exchange infrastructure  
- Nihao:
  - Uses **escrow** accounts (CEA and cash held by neutral agent)  
  - Executes **atomic settlement** (either both legs clear or neither)  
  - Has **Lloyd’s‑backed coverage (target €75M)** for settlement failure / counterparty risk  

**Reputation & Confidentiality**

- Exchange trades are visible, at least indirectly:
  - Sharp volume spikes reveal large sellers  
  - Competitors, regulators, and local government may infer weakness or over‑allocation  
- Nihao:
  - Deals are bilateral and confidential  
  - No public order book impact  
  - Protects SOEs and large industrials from signalling their positions  

**Result for CEA Sellers**

Using Nihao is rational if the seller wants:

- Higher net price per CEA  
- Better tax outcome  
- Faster, insured and predictable settlement  
- Reduced regulatory and reputational noise  

***

## 2. EU BUYERS – WHY BUY CEA FROM NIHAO & SWAP INTO EUA INSTEAD OF DIRECT EUA BUY

### 2.1 EU Reality: ETS + CBAM

Typical EU industrial:

- Produces or imports carbon‑intensive goods (steel, cement, aluminium, fertilizers, etc.)  
- Faces:
  - **EU ETS** obligations (needs EUA) and/or  
  - **CBAM** from 2026 onward on imported embedded emissions  

Key facts (illustrative):

- EUA prices: historically in the **€60–85/t** range, with scenarios well above that in the 2030s–2040s  
- CBAM effectively multiplies the carbon cost into the trade dimension  
- Many EU companies now seek **multi‑jurisdictional carbon hedging**, not just local EUA   

Nihao offers EU buyers:

1. Access to **CEA** (China allowances) they otherwise cannot source easily  
2. A **CEA→EUA swap channel** at negotiated ratios  
3. A way to **structure CBAM and ETS exposure** more intelligently over time  

***

### 2.2 Example: EU Steel Manufacturer with CBAM Exposure

Assume:

- EU steel producer, 2M tonnes of steel/year  
- Embedded emissions: 2.1 tCO₂ per tonne → 4.2M tCO₂/year  
- EUA price: **€85/t**  
- CBAM reference: same order of magnitude per tonne CO₂  

**Direct EUA‑only approach (baseline)**

- To hedge 4.2M tCO₂, the firm buys **4.2M EUA** annually  
- Cost: 4.2M × €85 = **€357M/year** (ignoring transaction fees)  
- Add:
  - Broker/clearing fees  
  - Compliance systems and MRV  
  - CBAM admin work  

Total annual carbon‑related cash outflow easily **≥€360M**.

Over 3 years: **~€1.08B**.

***

### 2.3 Nihao Strategy: CEA Purchase + CEA→EUA Swaps Over Time

The goal is not to “magically get cheaper EUA” (regulators would block this), but to:

- Use **CEA as a parallel exposure** that can appreciate as China ETS deepens  
- Use **swaps** to balance EUA needs while monetizing CEA appreciation  
- Reduce **multi‑year net carbon cost** rather than just Year 1 nominal spend  

**Simplified multi‑year example**

Year 1:

- Instead of buying only EUA, the firm decides to:
  - Purchase a significant block of CEA via Nihao at **€8.5/t**  
  - Use part of that CEA to swap into EUA required for current‑year compliance  
  - Keep a remaining CEA portfolio as strategic carbon asset  

Assume:

- Buys **44.1M CEA** at €8.5/t → €374.85M  
- Swaps **40M CEA** into EUA at a **1:10.5 ratio** via Nihao (i.e., 40M CEA ↔ 3.81M EUA)  
- Uses EUA for compliance and CBAM hedging in Year 1  
- Keeps **4.1M CEA** as a long position  

Year 2 (CEA market strengthens):

- CEA price rises to **€12/t** as China expands ETS sectors and tightens caps  
- Value of remaining 4.1M CEA: 4.1M × (€12–€8.5) = **€14.35M gain** on this residual block alone  
- Firm can selectively:
  - Sell further CEA to finance future EUA purchases  
  - Swap more CEA into EUA at favorable ratios  
  - Or use documented CEA holdings to reduce effective CBAM liability (depending on the final CBAM design)  

Over 3 years, an actively managed strategy can:

- Transform a flat **€1.08B” EUA‑only** spend into a **~€700–750M** net multi‑year spend  
- Generate **€300M+** in savings via:
  - Portfolio gains on CEA  
  - Timing CEA→EUA swaps  
  - CBAM relief where CEA “domestic carbon payment” can be recognized  

The precise numbers depend on actual price paths, but structurally the logic is:

> Use Nihao to convert a fixed annual carbon cost into a **managed carbon portfolio**, with CEA as the “alpha leg” and EUA as the “compliance leg”.

***

### 2.4 Concrete Advantages for EU Buyers

#### 2.4.1 Economic & Hedging Benefits

1. **Diversification of carbon exposure**  
   - Pure EUA exposure is one‑dimensional and tightly linked to EU policy  
   - Adding CEA via Nihao introduces exposure to **China ETS reforms**, which may have different timing and magnitude  

2. **Potential upside from CEA re‑pricing**  
   - CEA currently trade at a multiple discount vs EUA  
   - If CEA prices converge upward (which is plausible as China tightens ETS), EU buyers with CEA positions benefit significantly  

3. **Swap ratios negotiated, not dictated**  
   - Nihao can often negotiate CEA↔EUA swap ratios slightly better than instantaneous spot ratios  
   - Even a **0.5–1% improvement** on multi‑million‑tonne positions translates into **hundreds of thousands of euros**, sometimes millions  

4. **Staged hedging rather than one‑off buying**  
   - Instead of buying all EUA at once each year, EU buyers can gradually:
     - Accumulate CEA when cheap  
     - Swap into EUA when necessary or when ratios are attractive  

***

#### 2.4.2 Tax & Accounting Benefits (High‑Level)

Depending on jurisdiction and structuring:

- CEA acquired via Nihao can be accounted for as **inventory or intangible assets**, not necessarily as financial instruments:
  - May allow **full expense recognition** when used or sold  
  - May offer more flexible tax timing vs financial assets  

- Fees paid to Nihao (and associated advisory costs) are generally **deductible operating expenses**  
- VAT on Nihao fees and certain services may be **recoverable**  
- Proper documentation provided by Nihao can:
  - Support CBAM filings  
  - Support transfer pricing and cross‑border tax positions  

Every EU buyer will need local tax counsel, but the overall pattern is:

> Compared to simple EUA trades via financial brokers, the Nihao route can often generate **better VAT recovery** and **more favorable CIT timing**.

***

#### 2.4.3 Operational, Legal & Compliance Benefits

1. **No need to build full in‑house ETS trading infrastructure**  
   - Instead of becoming an active exchange participant, the EU buyer:
     - Deals with Nihao as a service provider  
     - Receives CEA/EUA in registry accounts with fully packaged documentation  

2. **CBAM documentation support**  
   - Nihao can generate:
     - Counterparty audit trails  
     - Transaction evidence for carbon paid in China ETS  
     - Linkages between CEA holdings and imported flows  

3. **Reduced administrative burden**  
   - Nihao handles much of the complexity (KYC of Chinese counterparties, registry interactions, etc.)  
   - Internal carbon compliance teams can shrink or reallocate effort  

4. **Legal certainty around complex cross‑border flows**  
   - Nihao is set up specifically to operate at the intersection: China ETS – EU ETS – Hong Kong  
   - EU buyer benefits from a standardized contractual + documentation framework instead of designing everything from scratch  

***

### 2.5 Summary – Why an EU Buyer Rationally Uses Nihao

For large EU industrials or importers with CBAM exposure:

- **Direct EUA purchase** is simple but expensive and one‑dimensional  
- **Nihao CEA purchase + swap** transforms the problem into:
  - A multi‑year portfolio optimization  
  - A combination of CEA upside + EUA compliance  
  - A CBAM documentation and cost‑reduction tool  

Even with conservative assumptions, the multi‑year savings can be extremely significant (tens to hundreds of millions for large emitters).

## 3. EUA HOLDERS (FUNDS / CORPORATES) – WHY SWAP EUA → CEA VIA NIHAO

### 3.1 Typical Holder Profile

- Sovereign wealth fund, corporate treasury, or climate fund  
- Holds **€100–500M** in EUA as:
  - A hedge against EU climate policy  
  - A “green” thematic exposure  
- Observes that:
  - EUA upside may be partially priced in  
  - CEA are still cheap relative to EUA  
  - China ETS is expanding sectors, implying more demand for CEA  

They would like to **rotate some EUA exposure into CEA**.

They have two approaches:

1. Sell EUA in the market, then buy CEA in China  
2. Execute an **atomic EUA↔CEA swap** via Nihao  

***

### 3.2 Scenario A – Direct Sale of EUA & Separate CEA Purchase

Assume:

- 5.88M EUA position  
- Cost basis ~€85/EUA → **~€500M** notional  

**Direct approach:**

1. Sell 5.88M EUA via ICE / EEX:
   - This may be **1–2+ days of typical EU ETS volume**  
   - Large sale → price impact and slippage (e.g. 2–3% downward)  
   - Execution price might average **€82–83/t** rather than €85  
   - Proceeds ≈ €484–488M  

2. Convert EUR proceeds into RMB or HKD for use in China:
   - FX and banking fees ~0.25–0.5% → €1–2.5M  

3. Time delay:
   - Cross‑border settlement, regulatory checks → days to weeks  
   - During this time, CEA prices may move against the buyer  

4. Buy CEA in China:
   - If CEA price moves slightly higher (e.g. from €8.5 to €8.8), the fund pays more than planned  
   - Purchase volume ≈ planned CEA quantity, but at a somewhat worse price  

Net effect:

- Slippage on EUA sale  
- FX friction  
- Adverse timing risk on CEA purchase  
- Operational complexity and multiple transaction legs  

Total economic “leakage” in the 4–7% range on the position is entirely plausible, i.e. **€20–35M** on a €500M book.

***

### 3.3 Scenario B – Atomic EUA→CEA Swap via Nihao

Same position: 5.88M EUA, ~€500M at €85/EUA.

Nihao offers:

1. A **locked CEA:EUA ratio** slightly better than the implied screen ratio  
   - Market: €85 EUA vs €8.5 CEA → 1:10 exactly  
   - Nihao negotiated ratio: **1:10.5**  
   - For every EUA, the holder gets 10.5 CEA instead of 10  

2. **Atomic settlement**:
   - Both EUA and CEA are moved into a neutral escrow structure  
   - Only when both sides are in place does the swap finalize  
   - If anything fails, the system rolls back to pre‑trade state  

3. **No FX conversion** (if desired):
   - The fund can keep overall value effectively in EUR terms while gaining CEA exposure  

Numerically:

- 5.88M EUA × 10.5 CEA/EUA = **61.74M CEA**  
- At an indicative €8.5/CEA, this is **€524.79M of CEA value** (vs ~€500M of EUA sold)  
- That extra ~€25M is essentially the “ratio improvement” embedded in the Nihao swap and/or the absence of slippage/fx/costs that plague the direct approach.

Economic outcome:

- No multi‑day slippage  
- No FX friction  
- No separate CEA‑purchase timing risk  
- Clean, documented swap with clear tax and accounting treatment  

***

### 3.4 Strategic Rationale – From EUA‑Only to EUA+CEA Portfolio (or CEA‑Only)

From a portfolio‑management viewpoint:

- EUA represent an exposure to **EU climate policy**, matured and partly priced in  
- CEA represent an exposure to **China climate policy**, earlier in the tightening cycle, potentially with more upside  

Swapping via Nihao allows the holder to:

1. Take profits or rotate out of EUA without sending a massive **sell signal** to the market.  
2. Enter CEA exposure at a competitive ratio with **near‑zero friction**.  
3. Optionally use CEA later as:
   - A source of cash (selling appreciated CEA)  
   - An asset for further structured deals (back‑to‑EUA swaps, Article 6‑type structures, etc.)  

If, in 2–3 years:

- EUA are flat or slightly down, say €70  
- CEA have moved from €8.5 to €15  

Then:

- The original **EUA‑only** holder would have seen a significant drawdown  
- The **Nihao CEA swap** holder would have seen large appreciation on the new CEA holdings  

Even after taxation, fees, and risk hedging, the **risk‑adjusted return** of shifting some percentage of EUA into CEA via Nihao can be materially superior.

***

### 3.5 Why EUA Holders Choose Nihao – Condensed

Key reasons:

- **Economic** – better effective CEA quantity for the same EUA, no slippage, no FX leakage  
- **Operational** – simpler, single transaction instead of 4–6 complex ones  
- **Risk** – insured, atomic execution instead of staged execution across jurisdictions  
- **Strategic** – ability to look through short‑term price noise and position for structural CEA repricing  

***

## 4. SUMMARY BY PARTICIPANT TYPE

### 4.1 CEA Sellers (China)

- Higher net price per CEA (~**+8–10%** vs direct exchange)  
- Potential **tax savings** on the order of **millions** (for multi‑million CEA blocks) due to VAT and CIT structure  
- Faster cash conversion (days vs weeks)  
- Confidential execution, reduced political/regulatory signalling  
- FX diversification (can be paid in EUR, USD, etc., not only RMB)  
- Benefit from Nihao’s insured and structured settlement  

**Net takeaway**: For surplus CEA holders above a certain scale (e.g. >500k CEA/year), Nihao is financially and strategically superior to direct exchange selling.

***

### 4.2 EU Buyers (CEA Purchasing + CEA→EUA Swaps)

- Move from a pure “annual EUA bill” to a **managed carbon portfolio**  
- Use cheap CEA exposure as a lever:
  - To hedge CBAM  
  - To gain upside from China ETS reforms  
- Potentially reduce **multi‑year carbon cost** by **tens to hundreds of millions** for large emitters/importers  
- Obtain better VAT/CIT treatment on associated services and positions  
- Offload operational and legal complexity (ETS access, CBAM documentation) onto Nihao  

**Net takeaway**: For mid‑ to large‑cap EU industrials and importers with CBAM exposure, Nihao offers a path to transform carbon compliance from a pure cost center into a portfolio that can generate financial upside.

***

### 4.3 EUA Holders (Funds / Corporates)

- Avoid slippage, FX costs and operational drag of selling EUA and separately buying CEA  
- Lock in **favorable CEA quantities** via negotiated swap ratios  
- Gain CEA exposure at minimal friction, positioning ahead of China ETS tightening  
- Preserve confidentiality and avoid broadcasting large EUA exits  
- Potentially achieve **8–10% better effective position** on large books simply by using the Nihao swap channel  

**Net takeaway**: For any institution with sizable EUA positions and a medium‑term horizon, Nihao’s EUA→CEA swap is a rational, high‑efficiency rotation tool.
